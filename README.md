# Todoly

Todoly is a productivity app designed for android users with their everyday tasks, reminders, and their study habits. 

You will be able to save tasks and reminders. You can study or focus on a task using our pomodoro timer, studying in 30min increments. 

Currently not deployed for public's use, however, code and emulator running can be used by:

    1. Downloading Android Studio
    2. Clone project
    3. Run emulator

Visit our User Guide in the Wiki to see how to use the features!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Our team used Figma to make mock-up examples of our app. 

We used Android Studio to create the app.

This app was built using Kotlin and Java as our backend, and XML as our frontend portion.
